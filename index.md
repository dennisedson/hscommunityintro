Oh, Hi.  Didn't see you there.  
My name is Dennis.  You may have seen me in here before.  This is where I learned most of what I know about developing on HubSpot.    
I just received my HubSpot wings a bit over a month ago and now I am officially the Community Manager who will be keeping an eye on the CMS and API boards!  
10 things you should know about me
1. I was the Director of Web Production for an agency prior to this.  It sounds pretty fancy, but in reality, I considered myself to be a [glorified janitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v2mEg9Cpvs) :) 
2. I built my first website on [geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) circa 1996 from my [high school library](https://ihs.usd257.org/).  
3. No joke, [myspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace) was instrumental in my really learning CSS.
4. Before becoming a full time web developer, my previous occupations were Park Ranger and Photographer.  
5. I like to use chickens as more lorem ipsum content (words, pictures and video).  If you happen across some good chicken content out there, send it my way
6. I really try to like playing video games, but just never get into it.  I was a big fan of [Below the Root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Below_the_Root_(video_game)) on my [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64).  I bought the [Google Stadia](https://store.google.com/product/stadia_learn) recently.  We will see.
7. I am super curious and always ready to talk about things.  Anything really...well...almost.  I have no interest in the [Real Housewives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives) of whatever city
8. I like sugar. **a lot**.  This fact may be influenced by the bag of [Almond Joy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeibzLZn2hU) sitting in front of me that I can't stop staring at
9. My nickname as a child was Boog.  I still don't know why.
10. I firmly believe [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) is the best browser particularly for its dev tools


I am incredibly excited to get to play with all of you smart folks!  If you have ideas or a good dad joke, please feel free to hit me up anytime.
